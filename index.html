    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Aidan Sainte. I am currently 17 years old of age
        and I attend Portsmouth Abbey School in Rhode Island. I have
        a younger brother named Preston, and we live in Hackettstown New jersey
        I have many interests rangning from gaming all the way to track and wrestling 
        and I would like to share that on my personal website.

    <h1>Studies</h1>
    <p>As of I write now, I don't have any particular course
        of action in regard to any career path based on my studies,
        but I do have an idea about what I like. I tend to lean more
        in terms of interest, towards the humanities/english and chemistry 
        side of things. My dad's a chemist, so I've been around that type of
        stuff to the point it has become second nature almost, and I have 
        a natural affinity for the sciences. As for the humanities, I've been 
        writing and reading constantly since I was little, and that passion
        has not died since especially with ever-growing imagination

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p> Like most teenagers my age, I enjoy playing video-games, sports, and reading books.
        I do most of gaming on pc that parents bought for me on my 15th birthday, and either 
        play multiplayer games with my friends on discord or long, adventure, singleplayer games.
        As for sports, I run cross-country, track and I wrestle competitvely at my school, but I also 
        play a lot of recreational basketball in my free time as well. As for reading, I primarily enjoy
        fantasy like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson that activate my imagination constantly.

    <h1>Family Tree</h1>
    <p> My Family Tree is of pretty large, so I'll simply just cut it down to immediates. My dad has two brothers and one sister. One 
        of my uncles has three sons, while my other one has one son and a daughter, and my aunt has two daughters. My mom has one brother
        and one sister who are both single and don't have kids, so whenever my brother and I visit them over the summer, we become their kids
